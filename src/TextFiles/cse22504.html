                the two dimensional steady boundary layer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .
                solutions for the boundary layer thickness , skin friction , and the velocity distribution in the boundary layer are obtained by the karman pohlhausen technique . comparison with the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also been made to show the effect of vorticity .
