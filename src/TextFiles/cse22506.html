                in a recent contribution to the readers forum wassermann gave analytic solutions for the temperature in a double layer slab , with a triangular heat rate input at one face , insulated at the other , and with no thermal resistance at the interface . his solutions were for the three particular cases . . i propose here to give the general solution to this problem , to indicate briefly how it is obtained using the method of reference , and to point out that the solutions given by wassermann are incomplete for times longer than the duration of the heat input .
